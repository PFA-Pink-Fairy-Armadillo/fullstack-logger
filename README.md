# About
Fullstack-monitor is express middleware that provides log monitoring tools for developers, offering visibility of console logs, requests and responses from both the Client and Server side of your application in one single place.

This makes it easy to see what is happening across the stack as your front and back-end communicate.

In order to use this, you must also install the [Fullstack-Monitor-CLI](https://github.com/PFA-Pink-Fairy-Armadillo/fullstack-monitor-cli) npm package.

- [Fullstack-Monitor-CLI Github](https://github.com/PFA-Pink-Fairy-Armadillo/fullstack-monitor-cli).
- [Fullstack-Monitor-CLI NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fullstack-monitor-cli).
